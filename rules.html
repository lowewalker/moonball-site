  <h1>Moonball Rules</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The ball is lightweight (100 g) and the size of a volleyball.</li>
      <li>The court and net dimensions are the same as pickleball.</li>
      <li>A player can hit the ball over the net with any part of their body.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To start the match, a coin toss determines the side to serve first.  The side to serve first alternates in subsequent games.</li>
      <li>Switch sides of the court after every game.</li>
      <li>The side that wins the point serves the next ball.</li>
      <li>A player can let the ball bounce or hit it straight out of the air from anywhere on the court.</li>
      <li>A side scores a point if the other side hits the ball out, fails to return a ball, or commits a fault.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Serve</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The server can stand anywhere on their side of the court to serve.</li>
      <li>The receiver can stand anywhere on their side of the court to receive the serve.</li>
      <li>After the server hits the serve, it must bounce on the server's court before going over the net.</li>
      <li>The receiver must let the serve bounce on their court before returning it.</li>
      <li>The serve is the only time a player may hit the ball onto their own court before it goes over.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Games are played to 10 points; win by 2.</li>
      <li>Sets are played to 50 points. Each game counts for 10 (even if the final score is 11-9).</li>
      <li>Example: Side A has won 3 games; Side B was won 1 game. The set score is 30-10.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Two-Point Rule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A player can score 2 points if they play the ball over without using their hands or arms.</li>
      <li>If the opposing team cannot return a no-hand ball, or returns it into the net, the result is 2 points.</li>
      <li>If the opposing team returns a no-hand ball over the net but out, the result is 1 point.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Faults</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Touching the net during gameplay with any part of the body is a fault.</li>
      <li>Impeding the arm swing or follow-through of a player at the net is a fault.</li>
      <li>Hitting the ball twice is a fault. Exception: if the ball contacts the player's body multiple times within the
        same overall motion, no fault is committed.</li>
    </ul>
